Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as 
necessary to improve readability.

Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

The Google Python Style Guide has the following convention:
module_name, package_name, ClassName, method_name, ExceptionName, function_name, 
GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, global_var_name, instance_var_name, 
function_parameter_name, local_var_name.

Names to Avoid
single character names except for counters or iterators
dashes (-) in any package/module name
\__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ names (reserved by Python)

Naming Convention
Use CapWords for class names, but lower_with_under.py for module names. 
Although there are many existing modules named CapWords.py, this is now 
discouraged because it's confusing when the module happens to be named after 
a class.

PEP 8 Recommendations:
joined_lower for functions, methods, attributes, variables
ALL_CAPS for constants
StudlyCaps for classes
